Introduction to LightRAG

LightRAG is a simple and fast Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system developed by the Hong Kong University Data Science Institute (HKUDS). 
This project aims to reduce the complexity of existing RAG systems while maintaining performance.

Key Features:
1. Simple Architecture: Get started quickly without complex configurations.
2. Fast Performance: Supports fast retrieval and generation with efficient algorithms.
3. Flexibility: Compatible with various LLMs and embedding models.
4. Scalability: Capable of processing large-scale documents.

LightRAG uses a knowledge graph-based approach to understand relationships between documents, 
enabling more accurate information retrieval and answer generation.

The system achieves superior performance compared to existing solutions like GraphRAG, 
with win rates exceeding 80% in comprehensiveness and diversity metrics.
